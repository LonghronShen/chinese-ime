Chinese Input Method Editor (IME)
===========

A JavaScript jQuery plugin for building Chinese keyboard input capabilities natively into a website.

Introduction
-----------

This Chinese IME is a JavaScript jQuery plugin that allows you to easily build the ability to type in Chinese characters into your website. The target users here are probably not native Chinese speakers who are very familiar with Chinese input methods, but rather those learning Chinese as a second language. Someone new to the language might not yet have installed an IME onto their OS, or might not yet know how to use it. If that sounds like your main audience, this is for you. This plugin is easy and intuitive to use for beginners and experts alike, and doesn't interfere with built-in OS input methods.
